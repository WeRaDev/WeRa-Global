# CLAUDE.md
Compatibility shim for tools that still look for Claude-specific instruction filenames.

## Canonical instruction file
- The provider-agnostic source of truth is `AGENTS.md`.
- `WARP.md` remains the governance/process source of truth.

## Compatibility rule
- If a tool only reads `CLAUDE.md`, apply all instructions from `AGENTS.md`.
- If any guidance differs, `AGENTS.md` takes precedence.
